         <h2 id="section2">Biography</h1>
         Daniel is a 21 y/o driven and ambitious cybersecurity and DevOps enthusiast with a strong passion for technology, security, and cloud engineering. With a 4.48/5.0 GPA from the Airforce Institute of Technology, Kaduna, they are on a mission to master the intricacies of offensive security, DevOps, and cloud computing, with the ultimate goal of becoming a highly skilled Red Teamer and DevOps/Cloud Engineer in the Nigerian Air Force.

Currently, Daniel is studying for the OSCP and PNPT certifications, sharpening their penetration testing skills while also exploring the DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) space. <br>They are particularly interested in containerizing applications, cloud deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and observability‚Äîcritical skills that bridge security and software development.

Beyond technical skills, Daniel is actively searching for a fully or partially funded MSc program in Information Security in the UK, leveraging their strong academic background to pursue advanced studies in cybersecurity. <br> They also have aspirations to pursue a PhD in the field, further cementing their expertise in information security and technology.

In addition to cybersecurity and DevOps, Daniel is intrigued by Web3 technologies and financial markets, including stock and forex trading. <br>They believe in intentional living and personal growth, constantly pushing themselves to find balance between ambition and well-being.

A hands-on learner, they are currently working as a CyberSecurity Instuctor, and on a Linux crash course book, aiming to educate and empower students with foundational Linux knowledge. <br>With an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence, Daniel is steadily carving a path toward becoming a leading expert in cybersecurity, cloud engineering, and SecDevOps Engineering.

Daniel's birthday is on the 7th September, and would appreciate gifts of internship opportunities from you wink:wink<br>

         <h2 id="section3">Goals & Purpose for Enrolling at Altschool</h1>
         <p>My ultimate goal is to become a highly skilled and sought-after DevSecOps engineer, seamlessly integrating security into the software development and deployment lifecycle. In today‚Äôs evolving technology landscape, where security threats are increasingly sophisticated, I believe that a deep understanding of backend engineering is crucial for implementing robust, scalable, and secure systems.

            By enrolling in this Backend Engineering track, I aim to build a solid foundation in software development‚Äîlearning the core principles of designing, building, and optimizing backend services. A strong grasp of backend technologies will enable me to develop, secure, and automate the infrastructure and pipelines that drive modern applications.
            
            One of my primary objectives is to gain hands-on experience in designing 3-tier applications, which will serve as practical case studies for mastering key DevSecOps concepts. These include:
            
        </ul>
            <li>Secure containerization to ensure applications run in isolated and hardened environments.</ul>
            
            <li>Container orchestration and management to efficiently deploy and scale workloads.</li>
            
            <li>Configuration management and infrastructure as code (IaC) for maintaining secure, repeatable deployments.</li>
            
            <li>CI/CD pipeline development to streamline automated testing, security scanning, and deployment processes.</li>
            
            <li>Cloud deployment strategies to secure workloads on cloud platforms while enforcing best practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Beyond just acquiring technical skills, this program will also help me develop a security-first mindset, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of every stage of the development lifecycle. As a future DevSecOps engineer, I want to play a critical role in securing software supply chains and delivery pipelines, mitigating vulnerabilities before they become risks, and advocating for secure software development practices across teams.
            
            By completing this program, I will be equipped with the expertise to bridge the gap between development, operations, and security‚Äîultimately helping organizations build secure, high-performing, and resilient applications. This is more than just a learning experience for me; it is a strategic investment in my future, paving the way for me to make impactful contributions to the field of DevSecOps.</p>
